### This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). A modern application that leverages all of the latest and greatest of what Next 13 has to offer, leveraging features such as server-side rendering and the app router.

Alongside building this application, i've also learned how to:
- Use Next.js 13 App Router and Server Side Rendering
- Implement Advanced Search Functionality
- Create Filtering Capabilities
- Optimize Metadata and SEO
- Create custom filter, combobox, and modal elements
- Maintain a well-organized file and folder structure.
- Embrace the principles of writing clean code.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
